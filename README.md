# CNN Multivariate Time Series Processing
CNN for multivariate time series processing with TensorFlow

Two frameworks including:
1. **CNN as [Acceptor](https://github.com/bujingyi/rnn-multivariate-time-series/blob/master/README.md)**
2. **Multi-Channel CNN**

for solving multivariate time series
1. forecasting
2. classification

respectively.

CNN as Acceptor was wrappered in TensorFlow's high level API - Estimators, Experiments, and Datasets.
